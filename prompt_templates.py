instruction_following_template = """# Instruction Following Assessment

Evaluate the assistant's fidelity to provided instructions. Assess how accurately the assistant's responses align with user directives, noting any deviations and their justification.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Precision in Following Instructions**: Does the assistant adhere to the specifics of the provided instructions?
- **Justification for Deviations**: If deviations occur, are they justified by critical necessity or explicit user request?
- **Alignment with User Directives**: How well do the assistant's responses  match the userâ€™s specified needs and expectations?
- **Necessity of Deviations**: Are any deviations from instructions made only in situations deemed absolutely necessary or upon direct user request?

**Scoring**: Rate outputs on a scale of 1 to 5:
1. **Non-Compliant**: The assistant frequently deviates from instructions without necessity or user consent.
2. **Minimally Compliant**: The assistant shows some adherence to instructions but deviates without strong justification.
3. **Moderately Compliant**: The assistant generally follows instructions, with deviations occurring but justified by necessity or user request.
4. **Highly Compliant**: The assistant closely follows instructions, with few deviations, all of which are well justified.
5. **Fully Compliant**: The assistant exhibits perfect adherence to instructions, with deviations only when critically necessary and explicitly approved by the user.
